# Rubiks-Cube

3D Rubikâ€™s Cube.

MVP: 

- large cube made of 27 smaller cubes, each face a different color 
- entire large cube rotatable so can see all sides 
- each cross section of larger cube rotatable so can change positioning of smaller cubes

Ideally will look something like this:

Libraries:
- will implement using this library: https://threejs.org/

Implementation Time Line:

Day 1:  
- get set up
- play around with three js
- figure out how to render one simple large 3d cube that rotates

Day 2: 
- break cube into smaller cubes and all cross sections
- focus on just the 3 horizontal cross sections, figure out how to rotate those 

Day 3: 
- get entire cube working 

Bonus:
- have button to automatically scramble cube
